  ⚠️ We're in our new venue at [St Gregory the Great Catholic Secondary School](https://goo.gl/maps/LM89ws6Sns82) ️ ⚠️

  We'll be in the "conference room" that is through the main entrance of the old building and to the right. We'll be about to direct people.

  There is plenty of parking available and a main [bus route](https://goo.gl/maps/DNqFht9VsXK2) close by. Once you arrive enter through the entrance marked on the map below.

  We will be providing drinks and snacks thanks to our wonderful sponsors but please be aware the venue doesn't allow alcohol so we'll be providing a range of tasty non-alcoholic beverages.

    title: "[Gordon Williams](https://twitter.com/espruino) - Zero to Hardware in 30 Minutes"
    description: |
      In a world where our consumer devices are developed by huge corporations with 9 figure budgets, creating your own hardware product to sell can seem completely out of reach.

      In this talk Gordon will show you how you can create a prototype, program the device and an app with JavaScript, design a manufacturable circuit board, design and 3D print a case, and get it manufactured in quantity - in 30 minutes. There will be demos along the way as well.

    description: |
      We'll explore Protocol Buffers & gRPC as a way of serving content to your front-end code. We'll dive into some of the technical features and tooling, as well as chatting through some architectural differences to help you choose whether a service-based API approach would be a good fit with your current or future web projects.

      If I find time to hack up some demos before this talk - then we'll check out those as well!
