      Life in the early days of the web was hard. One day your HTML is disintegrating, the next you are fighting someone named "~Ninjad00d~" who has found a way to take over your forum system. Lessons in security in these days were hard learned.

      These are the true stories from the early days of the web and how forums, chat rooms and online games were turned upside down for fun and profit. If you stick around after laughing at the misfortune of online pioneers, there will also be lessons about finding your way in a world that wants to exploit your every mistake.

    title: "[Jessica Rose](https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose) - Contributing to Mozilla"
    description: |
      If you're willing to sit through a talk on contributing you're may already be passionate about some of the things Mozillans do to build a better internet, contribute to cutting edge technologies or to help teach and share knowledge. You may even have a favourite project in mind. In this talk we're going to look at a range of different volunteer and contribution opportunities across Mozilla projects that could use a little bit of TLC from you. We'll examine how volunteer efforts power these projects, what impact your contribution could make and talk about the impact volunteer efforts make across the web and the world.
