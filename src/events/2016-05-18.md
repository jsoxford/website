      Using the paradigm of Cathedrals vs Bazaars, this talk will focus on the current state of language learning applications and how they tackle the problem by creating a few complex things (Ferraris) when a focus on creating lots of simple combinable things (Ladas) might be better.

    title: "[Joe Reeve](https://twitter.com/JReeve0) - Full stack minus CSS - How CSS is slowly killing your users"
    description: |
      We all have strong opinions on CSS, whether good or bad. CSS can be really helpful, but if you don't think about how it works before writing selectors, you can seriously harm the performance of your page.

      We will take a look at browser implementations of CSS selectors and what that means for your CSS.
