      "Consider using <link rel=preload> to prioritize fetching resources that are currently requested later in page load" is the seemingly simple advice Lighthouse gives us.

      But…

      How do we ensure we use preload's capabilities effectively?

      Data from the HTTPArchive shows only a small number of sites are using preload. Some sites are using preload effectively, some have been tripped up by subtleties in how browsers and servers behave, and other cases it's actually making the site slower, so using preload effectively isn't as straightforward as it may first seem.

    description: |
      Video is one of the fastest growing mediums on the web and in mobile applications. Video files have been shown to increase engagement, and can be a great way to deliver your message quickly. (And who doesn’t love animated GIFs?)

      However, video that takes a long time to start up leads to frustration and abandonment. The same goes for video that stalls during playback.

      In this talk, you’ll learn best practices to optimize the delivery of your video to you customers, ensuring fast delivery and minimizing stalls for a great customer experience.
