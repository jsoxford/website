    title: "[Jon Acker](https://twitter.com/thebddadvocate) - Example First / A Sane Test-Driven Approach to Programming"
    description: |
      We all know we need automated tests for our code - they are our guardian angel against regression bugs. But what exactly is the point in writing a test in advance - how does this even make sense? The first thing to grasp is that, at this stage, these are not tests - but specifications, which force us to think about exactly what we want to do - in advance.  In addition TDD/BDD provide a rigorous methodology, which can help to keep us sane whilst developing complex code in steady confident steps.
      <br><br>
      I will give an introduction to the test-driven method, showing some examples of how it can be practised in JavaScript, and finally (since both TDD and BDD are about driving code from examples) how BDD, as a completely outside-in approach can help get us started with TDD by driving code from higher-level business requirements first.

    title: "[Andy Davies](https://twitter.com/AndyDavies) - Inspecting iOS App Traffic with JavaScript"
    description: |
      What do you do when you want to understand how an iOS App communicates with it's API and you don't have the source code?
      <br><br>
      One option is to use a proxy like Charles or Fiddler, another is to use a dynamic instrumentation framework such as Frida to inject JavaScript into the App.
      <br><br>
      Andy will talk about the second approach, explain why he chose it and demonstrate the depth of data that can be captured. He'll also talk about some of the drawbacks and tradeoffs too.
