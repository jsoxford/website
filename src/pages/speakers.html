<h2>Speaking at JSOxford</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Talk are generally about JavaScript and related technologies but we also have an interest in more general web development and design.
    The main thing we're looking for is passion.
  </li>
  <li>
    We're not interested in product pitches. We do welcome talks about products as long as they are focused on the <em>how</em> rather than the <em>what</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you're interested in speaking at JSOxford we encourage you to come along to an event if you're able or check out some of our <a href="/archive/">previous meetups</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Talk slots are <strong>30-45 minutes</strong> long with <strong>2 talks per event</strong>. We are flexible with this so please reach out to us if you feel you could do a longer (ideally interactive) talk or you have an idea for a shorter lightning style talk.
  </li>
  <li>
    Our meetups are currently held at <a href="http://www.storymuseum.org.uk/">The Story Museum</a> which is very central in Oxford.
    It is easy to reach from the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Oxford+Railway+Station,+Park+End+Street,+Oxfordshire,+Oxford/The+Story+Museum,+Rochester+House,+42+Pembroke+St,+Oxford+OX1+1BP/@51.7521504,-1.2683431,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x4876c6a2790faf05:0xba97a9d53201a3c!2m2!1d-1.2699454!2d51.7534694!1m5!1m1!1s0x4876c6afffdb9abf:0x37007a572c93207d!2m2!1d-1.257986!2d51.750698!3e2">Train Station</a>, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Oxford+(Bus+Station),+Oxford/The+Story+Museum,+Rochester+House,+42+Pembroke+St,+Oxford+OX1+1BP/@51.7522993,-1.2618879,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x4876c6a4434a3237:0xe8855286b4e428a!2m2!1d-1.262528!2d51.753797!1m5!1m1!1s0x4876c6afffdb9abf:0x37007a572c93207d!2m2!1d-1.257986!2d51.750698!3e2">Bus Station</a> and there are also several paid <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/carparks/">Car Parks</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The setup at the venue uses a projector with a screen resolution of <strong>1920*1080</strong> when using HDMI. If you need sound for your presentation please do let us know so we can get this set up prior.
    There is also internet at the venue however it is not that reliable so please do have backup plans if you're planning to do any live demos.
  </li>
  <li>
    We aim to <strong>film our speakers</strong>. Please let us know in advance if you are not comfortable with this for any reason and we can skip it.
    We record the screen output directly as it's sent to the projector as well as a camera pointed at the speaker. We use a headset microphone to record the speaker's voice.
    You are free to use the video on your own blog or website.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please remember to bring any <strong>display adapters</strong> your machine may need. Our projector uses HDMI and we have a few adapters but not for every port so it's best to be prepared.
